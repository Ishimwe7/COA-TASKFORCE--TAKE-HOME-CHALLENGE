### Interactive Photo Gallery

#### Features

**Responsive Design**: The gallery adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
Hover Interaction: Displays additional details when a user hovers over a photo.
**Image Thumbnail Navigation**: Navigate through image thumbnails to view full-size images.
**Cross-browser Compatibility**: Ensures consistent performance across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

### Coding Challenges

### Array Manipulation

**Problem Statement**
Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

**Solution File**
Challenges/arrayMap.js

### String Transformation

**Problem Statement**
Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:

If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5, perform both operations in the order specified above.

**Solution File**
Challenges/stringTransform.js
